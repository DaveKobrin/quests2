# Interfaces and Types

## 1. Create an interfaces file

Store it at the root of your `src` folder.

## 2. Fix type annotation for event

Replace `any` with the correct type in the `createForm` file.

## 3. Make interfaces for function expressions

Three function expressions need annotations:

-   `getValue`
-   `setValue`
-   `handleSubmit` (in `createForm` file)

Create interfaces for them in the file you created above, then import and use them in the correct files.
