# Wanda's Wisdom: Session 2

In this session, we look at how to level up a basic **TypeScript** app with advanced features.

## Installing and Running the Repo

1. Make sure you have already forked the main repository to your own account and cloned it to your local computer
2. Within the Slalom Quests directory, enter into this app's folder and the subfolder for the second session: `cd wandas-wisdom/session-2`
3. Switch to the start branch: `git checkout start`
4. Install all Node modules: `npm i`
5. Start the app: `npm run start`

The last command will build then serve the app by using webpack, allowing you to view it at `http://localhost:8080`. Any changes you make to the code will automatically update the running site. Any errors will be displayed in your terminal.

## Guides for the Session

### Notes

Markdown files walking through the key concepts covered in this session have been provided in the [notes](notes) folder.

### Instructions

Markdown files with steps for how to solve the problem for this session have been provided in the [instructions](instructions) folder.

## Explaining the Code

### File Structure

- _public_: HTML and CSS files
- _src_: JS files
  - _data_: non-functional files with raw data to use in other files (e.g., the `quotes` array)
  - _utilities_: helper functions (e.g., `makeAllCaps`)
  - _generators_: functions to create DOM elements (e.g., `createDescription`)
  - _mutators_: functions to change DOM elements (e.g., `replaceTags`)

If you look in the HTML file, you'll notice two interesting features: it contains an empty `body` tag, and it imports a JS file with a name that doesn't match any of the existing JS files. The body will be filled in by the JS code (specifically, the functions from the generators folder), and the mystery file will be generated by the webpack when the app is run (and stored in a `dist` folder that the webpack will also generate).
