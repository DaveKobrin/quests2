# Wanda's Wisdom

This repository presents a simple **JavaScript** web application and demonstrates how it can be converted into **TypeScript** with some simple alterations. To facilitate some of this, the app uses **Node** and the **webpack** module under the hood.

The app itself merely displays a random quote, which the user can change with the click of a button. The quotes come from _Bartlett's Familiar Quotations_ (18th edition).

We have broken this up across three sessions. To view the code for the first session, `cd` into the [`session-1`](session-1) folder. Then follow the instructions there.
