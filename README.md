# Slalom Quests

This repo contains projects that are used in tandem with Slalom Quests sessions. Slalom Quests is a series of meetup events that will help you level up skills that will help you break into tech. Each session focuses on a different topic; it is neither a necessity nor a requirement to attend previous sessions in order to attend a future one.

## Using the Main Repo

Each folder inside this repo represents a different session and topic. `cd` into the topic of choice, and follow the README for instructions on how to set up that project.

Each session begins on the `start` branch (this repo's main branch), and final solutions are in the `solution` branch.

## Slalom Town Narrative

Slalom Town is a fictional town filled with various characters excelling at different vocations who need help to level up their businesses. For example, Perry is a potions maker who wants to use SQL to make organizing his data easier. In contrast, Wanda is a sage who wants to level up her website with TypeScript. Many other colorful denizens populate this metro with myriad needs. Each session or series will focus on a different one.
